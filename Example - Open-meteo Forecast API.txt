Data Source
Open-Meteo weather forecast APIs use weather models from multiple national weather providers. For each location worldwide, the best models will be combined to provide the best possible forecast.

Weather models cover different geographic areas at different resolutions and provide different weather variables. Depending on the model, data have been interpolated to hourly values or not all weather variables are available. With the drop down Weather models (just below the hourly variables), you can select and compare individual weather models.

You can find the update timings in the model updates documentation.

API Documentation
The API endpoint /v1/forecast accepts a geographical coordinate, a list of weather variables and responds with a JSON hourly weather forecast for 7 days. Time always starts at 0:00 today and contains 168 hours. If &forecast_days=16 is set, up to 16 days of forecast can be returned. All URL parameters are listed below:

Parameter	Format	Required	Default	Description
latitude, longitude	Floating point	Yes		Geographical WGS84 coordinates of the location. Multiple coordinates can be comma separated. E.g. &latitude=52.52,48.85&longitude=13.41,2.35. To return data for multiple locations the JSON output changes to a list of structures. CSV and XLSX formats add a column location_id.
elevation	Floating point	No		The elevation used for statistical downscaling. Per default, a 90 meter digital elevation model is used. You can manually set the elevation to correctly match mountain peaks. If &elevation=nan is specified, downscaling will be disabled and the API uses the average grid-cell height. For multiple locations, elevation can also be comma separated.
hourly	String array	No		A list of weather variables which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &hourly= parameter in the URL can be used.
daily	String array	No		A list of daily weather variable aggregations which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &daily= parameter in the URL can be used. If daily weather variables are specified, parameter timezone is required.
current	String array	No		A list of weather variables to get current conditions.
temperature_unit	String	No	celsius	If fahrenheit is set, all temperature values are converted to Fahrenheit.
wind_speed_unit	String	No	kmh	Other wind speed speed units: ms, mph and kn
precipitation_unit	String	No	mm	Other precipitation amount units: inch
timeformat	String	No	iso8601	If format unixtime is selected, all time values are returned in UNIX epoch time in seconds. Please note that all timestamp are in GMT+0! For daily values with unix timestamps, please apply utc_offset_seconds again to get the correct date.
timezone	String	No	GMT	If timezone is set, all timestamps are returned as local-time and data is returned starting at 00:00 local-time. Any time zone name from the time zone database is supported. If auto is set as a time zone, the coordinates will be automatically resolved to the local time zone. For multiple coordinates, a comma separated list of timezones can be specified.
past_days	Integer (0-92)	No	0	If past_days is set, yesterday or the day before yesterday data are also returned.
forecast_days	Integer (0-16)	No	7	Per default, only 7 days are returned. Up to 16 days of forecast are possible.
forecast_hours
forecast_minutely_15
past_hours
past_minutely_15	Integer (>0)	No		Similar to forecast_days, the number of timesteps of hourly and 15-minutely data can controlled. Instead of using the current day as a reference, the current hour or the current 15-minute time-step is used.
start_date
end_date	String (yyyy-mm-dd)	No		The time interval to get weather data. A day must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g. 2022-06-30).
start_hour
end_hour
start_minutely_15
end_minutely_15	String (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm)	No		The time interval to get weather data for hourly or 15 minutely data. Time must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g. 2022-06-30T12:00).
models	String array	No	auto	Manually select one or more weather models. Per default, the best suitable weather models will be combined.
cell_selection	String	No	land	Set a preference how grid-cells are selected.

apikey	String	No		Only required to commercial use to access reserved API resources for customers. The server URL requires the prefix customer-. See pricing for more information.
Additional optional URL parameters will be added. For API stability, no required parameters will be added in the future!

Hourly Parameter Definition
The parameter &hourly= accepts the following values. Most weather variables are given as an instantaneous value for the indicated hour. Some variables like precipitation are calculated from the preceding hour as an average or sum.
